# AEGIS Advantage Over the Market
**Unified Comparison Across Leading IAM/PAM Platforms**  
*2026-02-16 — v1.0*

## Executive Summary
AEGIS is an open, modular Identity Fabric architecture designed to converge federation (SSO/MFA), identity lifecycle governance (including NPAs/HPAs), privileged access (PAM), and policy/audit orchestration across hybrid and multi-cloud environments. This document compares AEGIS against leading market vendors to highlight where AEGIS provides strategic advantages (sovereignty, convergence, extensibility) and where vendor platforms may provide advantages (packaging, maturity, turnkey delivery).

## Scoring Key
- ✅ = Strong / native capability
- ⚠️ = Partial / integration-based
- ❌ = Not primary / limited

## Market Comparison
| Dimension | AEGIS | CyberArk | Ping Identity | ForgeRock | IBM Verify / Identity Fabric |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Identity Fabric (end-to-end governance) | ✅ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ |
| Federation / SSO / MFA | ✅ | ⚠️ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| IGA / Lifecycle (JML, access reviews) | ✅ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ |
| NPA / HPA lifecycle governance | ✅ | ✅ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ |
| PAM (JIT, sessions, recording) | ✅ | ✅ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ |
| Secrets management / rotation | ✅ | ✅ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ |
| Multi-cloud neutrality / sovereignty | ✅ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ |
| Vendor lock-in risk | Low | High | Medium–High | Medium–High | Medium–High |
| Open connectors / extensibility | ✅ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ |
| Audit fabric (cross-domain correlation) | ✅ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ |
| Zero Trust alignment (NIST 800-207) | ✅ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ |
| Time-to-value (packaged rollout) | ⚠️ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Strategic value (long-term governance) | ✅ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ |

## Where AEGIS Wins (Strategic Advantages)
- Provider-neutral Identity Fabric: governance spans cloud, on-prem, and edge consistently.
- Converged IAM/IGA/PAM: reduces fragmentation and eliminates policy gaps between domains.
- Reduced vendor lock-in: replaceable components and standardized connectors.
- Strong alignment to Zero Trust and auditability: policy enforcement and evidence generation by design.
- Designed for regulated environments: consistent governance supports DORA/ENS/ISO/NIST/CIS mapping.

## Where Vendor Platforms Often Win
- Packaged maturity: vendor platforms can be deployed faster when requirements are narrowly scoped.
- Enterprise support model: proven procurement and delivery for large rollouts.
- Deep feature sets in specific domains: e.g., CyberArk in PAM/secrets; Ping in federation/access management.

## Positioning Guidance
- If PAM-only is the goal: CyberArk is often the fastest route.
- If IAM federation and API access are the main goals: Ping Identity is often a strong platform choice.
- If a packaged identity platform is required: ForgeRock/IBM stacks can be suitable.
- If the strategic goal is converged governance across environments with sovereignty: AEGIS is the architecture-first answer.
