# AEGIS Advantage Over the Market
**Unified Comparison Across Leading IAM/PAM/IGA Platforms**  
*2026-02-16 — v1.1*

## Executive Summary
AEGIS is an open, modular Identity Fabric architecture designed to converge federation (SSO/MFA), identity lifecycle governance (including NPAs/HPAs), privileged access (PAM), and policy/audit orchestration across hybrid and multi-cloud environments. This document compares AEGIS against representative market leaders to highlight where AEGIS provides strategic advantages (sovereignty, convergence, extensibility) and where vendor platforms may provide advantages (packaging, maturity, turnkey delivery).

## Scoring Key
- ✅ = Strong / native capability
- ⚠️ = Partial / integration-based
- ❌ = Not primary / limited
- Low/Medium/High = qualitative lock-in risk indicator

| Vendor lock-in risk | Low | High | Medium–High | Medium–High | Medium–High | Medium–High | High | High |

## Where AEGIS Wins (Strategic Advantages)
- Provider-neutral Identity Fabric: consistent governance across cloud, on-prem and edge.
- Converged IAM/IGA/PAM: reduces fragmentation and closes gaps between domains.
- Reduced vendor lock-in: replaceable components and standardized connectors.
- Audit-first design: policy enforcement plus evidence generation across the fabric.
- Designed for regulated environments: coherent mapping to DORA/ENS/ISO/NIST/CIS and more.

## Where Vendor Platforms Often Win
- Packaged maturity: faster rollout when scope is narrow (e.g., IAM-only or PAM-only).
- Enterprise procurement & support: clear licensing, vendor SLAs, and established delivery models.
- Depth in a specific domain: CyberArk (PAM/secrets), Okta/Ping/Entra (SSO/MFA), SailPoint (IGA).

## Positioning Guidance
- If PAM-only is the goal: CyberArk is often the fastest route.
- If SSO/MFA and access management are the primary needs: Ping/Okta/Entra are common choices.
- If IGA (access reviews, SoD, lifecycle) is the main driver: SailPoint is a frequent pick.
- If the strategic goal is converged governance across environments with sovereignty: AEGIS is the architecture-first answer.
