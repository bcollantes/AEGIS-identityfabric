# AEGIS Alignment with NIST SP 800-207

**Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) – Technical Alignment Overview**  
*2026-02-17 — v1.0*

---

## 1. Executive Positioning

NIST SP 800-207 defines Zero Trust Architecture as an enterprise cybersecurity plan that applies zero trust concepts
across component relationships, workflow planning, and access policies.

Zero Trust is **not a product**. It is an architectural model built on:

- Continuous verification
- Identity-centric access control
- Dynamic policy enforcement
- Elimination of implicit trust
- Strong monitoring and telemetry

AEGIS does not claim to “be Zero Trust.”  
AEGIS provides:

> A Zero Trust–aligned Identity & Privileged Access Control Plane consistent with NIST SP 800-207 principles.

## 2. NIST Zero Trust Core Logical Components

| NIST Logical Component | Description |
|---|---|
| Policy Engine (PE) | Makes access decisions |
| Policy Administrator (PA) | Executes decisions |
| Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) | Enforces access control |
| Continuous Diagnostics & Monitoring | Telemetry & validation |
| Identity Provider | Authentication authority |

---

## 3. AEGIS Mapping to NIST 800-207

| NIST ZTA Component | AEGIS Equivalent | Role |
|---|---|---|
| Identity Provider | INDIGO IAM | SSO, MFA, federation |
| Policy Engine | XOMS | Identity lifecycle, policy logic |
| Policy Administrator | JumpServer (orchestration layer) | Applies policy decisions |
| Policy Enforcement Point | JumpServer session control | Enforces JIT, RBAC, session policies |
| Resource Access | OpenStack / Azure / AWS / On-Prem | Target systems |
| Continuous Monitoring | SIEM + audit logs | Event validation & anomaly detection |

---

## 4. Zero Trust Principles — Technical Alignment

### Principle 1: No Implicit Trust
- No trust based on internal subnet
- All privileged access mediated via controlled entry points
- Network location is not a trust factor

**Alignment:** High

### Principle 2: Continuous Verification
- SSO + MFA via federation layer
- Policy re-evaluation via identity governance engine
- JIT privilege model and session-level enforcement

**Alignment:** High (requires telemetry integration for full maturity)

### Principle 3: Least Privilege Access
- RBAC and scoped authorization
- Time-bounded privilege activation (JIT)
- Credential rotation and reduced standing privileges

**Alignment:** High

### Principle 4: Explicit Resource Access Control
- Token-based validation and policy enforcement
- Privileged session brokering
- Central policy orchestration across environments

**Alignment:** High

### Principle 5: Continuous Monitoring
- Privileged session recording
- Identity events logging
- SIEM integration readiness and audit evidence packaging

**Alignment:** Medium–High (depends on operational SIEM adoption)

---

## 5. Zero Trust Architecture Model Type

AEGIS aligns best with an **Identity-Centric + Policy Enforcement Zero Trust Model**.

AEGIS does not attempt network micro-segmentation.  
Instead, it centralizes identity governance and privileged enforcement.

---

## 6. Maturity Interpretation (Simplified)

| Level | Description | AEGIS Position |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Basic federation | Supported |
| 2 | Central policy orchestration | Supported |
| 3 | Privileged JIT enforcement + audit | Supported |
| 4 | Adaptive risk-based access | Partial (integration needed) |
| 5 | Automated policy intelligence | Future roadmap |

---

## 7. Gap Transparency (Credibility)

AEGIS does not natively include:

- AI-based adaptive risk scoring
- Device posture validation engine
- Micro-segmentation controller

These are typically integrated through security analytics platforms and network controls.

---

## 8. Publish-safe Statement

You can safely state:

> AEGIS provides a Zero Trust–aligned Identity and Privileged Access Control Plane consistent with the architectural principles defined in NIST SP 800-207.

Avoid claims like:
- “NIST certified”
- “Zero Trust certified”
- “Fully compliant with NIST”

---

## 9. Technical Verdict

AEGIS is structurally compatible with Zero Trust principles and can serve as a central **Identity & Privileged Access Control Plane**
within a NIST SP 800-207 aligned enterprise architecture.
