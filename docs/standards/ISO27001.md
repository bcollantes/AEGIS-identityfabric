# AEGIS Alignment with ISO/IEC 27001

## Executive Overview

ISO/IEC 27001 defines requirements for establishing, implementing, maintaining, and continually improving an Information Security Management System (ISMS).

AEGIS contributes to ISO 27001 alignment by strengthening identity governance, access control, privileged access management, and traceability across hybrid and multi-cloud environments. While ISO 27001 certification applies to an organization's ISMS, AEGIS provides technical capabilities that directly support Annex A control objectives.

## Key Contributions
- Centralized IAM and identity lifecycle governance (Joiner/Mover/Leaver)
- Least privilege enforcement via RBAC and scoped authorization
- Privileged access governance (JIT), session control and recording
- Comprehensive logging and audit trail integration (SIEM-ready)
- Separation of duties and approval workflows
- Cloud-neutral identity control across OpenStack, Azure, AWS and on-prem

## Alignment Table
| ISO 27001 Annex A Control Area | AEGIS Contribution | Impact |
|---|---|---|
| A.5 Organizational Controls | Defined identity governance ownership and policy orchestration | High |
| A.6 People Controls | Lifecycle management reduces orphaned accounts and excess privileges | High |
| A.8 Asset Management | Identity-based control over systems and services | Medium–High |
| A.9 Access Control | RBAC, least privilege, federation (SSO/MFA) | High |
| A.12 Operations Security | Privileged session control and credential rotation | High |
| A.16 Incident Management | Detailed identity and privileged audit trails | High |

## 1. ISMS Governance Support
- Centralized identity policy definition and enforcement.
- Role-based access modeling aligned with risk assessments.
- Periodic review mechanisms for privileged roles.

## 2. Identity and Access Management Controls (Annex A.9)
- Strong authentication (SSO + MFA).
- Role-based access control and scoped authorization.
- Identity lifecycle governance (JML process).
- Segregation of duties enforcement.

## 3. Privileged Access and Operations Security (Annex A.12)
- Just-in-Time privilege elevation.
- Session recording and command logging.
- Credential rotation and secrets governance.
- Reduced standing administrative privileges.

## 4. Logging, Monitoring and Incident Response (Annex A.16)
- Comprehensive identity event logging.
- Privileged access session traceability.
- SIEM integration for correlation and alerting.
- Forensic-ready audit evidence.

## 5. Continuous Improvement
- Metrics on standing privileges and role assignments.
- Policy drift detection across cloud providers.
- Roadmap-driven maturity improvements.
